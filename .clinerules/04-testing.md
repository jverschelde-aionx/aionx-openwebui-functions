# Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Provide unit tests covering all public functions and classes.  
- **Coverage Goals**: Aim for high code coverage (e.g., 90%+). Focus on critical paths.
- **Test Organization**: Place tests in the same folder as the corresponding modules with the same name and a `_tests` suffix.
- **Fast Feedback**: Tests should run quickly and reliably in all environments.
- **Continuous Integration**: Ensure automated tests pass before merging any changes.
