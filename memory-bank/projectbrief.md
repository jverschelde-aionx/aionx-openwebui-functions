# Project Brief: aionx-openwebui-functions

## Overview
This project creates custom functions for the Open WebUI chat interface. These functions extend the capabilities of the Open WebUI platform, providing additional functionality and integration options.

## Core Requirements
1. Develop custom functions that integrate with the Open WebUI chat interface
2. Follow Python coding standards (PEP 8, type hints, proper documentation)
3. Maintain comprehensive documentation for all features
4. Ensure thorough testing coverage (90%+)
5. Track architectural decisions through ADRs

## Goals
- Create a library of reusable functions that enhance the Open WebUI platform
- Provide clear documentation for developers to implement these functions
- Ensure high code quality through proper testing and linting
- Maintain a well-documented evolution of the project

## Scope
The project will focus on developing custom functions for the Open WebUI chat interface, including:
- Function development and implementation
- Documentation and examples
- Testing and validation
- Integration guidelines

## Constraints
- Must adhere to Python coding standards
- Must maintain comprehensive documentation
- Must include thorough testing
