# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initial project setup and structure
- Memory bank initialization
- Documentation framework establishment
- Project planning and requirements gathering

## Recent Changes
- Created project foundation
- Initialized memory bank with core files
- Established documentation structure
- Set up ADR templates and process

## Next Steps
- Develop initial custom function framework
- Create function templates and examples
- Set up testing infrastructure
- Implement first set of custom functions

## Active Decisions
- Using Python as the primary implementation language
- Following PEP 8 for coding standards
- Implementing comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- Establishing high test coverage (90%+) as a requirement
- Using ADRs to track architectural decisions

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Modular function design with clear interfaces
- Consistent error handling across all functions
- Thorough input validation
- Comprehensive testing
- Detailed documentation

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Project is in initial setup phase
- Documentation-first approach is being established
- Memory bank will serve as the source of truth for project knowledge
- ADRs will track important architectural decisions
