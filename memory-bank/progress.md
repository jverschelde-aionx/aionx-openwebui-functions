# Project Progress

## What Works
- Project foundation is established
- Documentation structure is in place
- ADR template and process is defined
- Memory bank is initialized

## What's Left to Build
- Custom function framework/architecture
- Function registration and discovery mechanism
- Integration layer with Open WebUI
- Example functions and templates
- Testing infrastructure
- Documentation for function developers
- CI/CD pipeline

## Current Status
**Project Phase**: Initial Setup
**Progress**: 10%
**Focus Area**: Project structure and documentation

The project is currently in the initial setup phase. The documentation structure has been established, and the memory bank has been initialized. The next phase will involve developing the custom function framework and implementing initial examples.

## Known Issues
- No implementation has started yet
- Integration details with Open WebUI platform need to be defined
- Function registration mechanism needs to be designed
